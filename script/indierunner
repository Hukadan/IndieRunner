####################################
### Outline for future structure ###
####################################

### 0. Create IndieRunner object ###

my $ir = IndieRunner->new();

### 1. Get Initial Data ###

say "engine: $$ir{ engine }";
say "engine_id_file: $$ir{ engine_id_file }";

# Game Name
unless ( $$ir{ game } ) {
	$ir->detect_game();
}
say "Game: $$ir{ game }";

### 2. Setup of Files (incl. Symlinks) ###

# chdir to the game directory
chdir $$ir{ game_dir } if $$ir{ game_dir };

my $engine_module = 'IndieRunner::' . $$ir{ engine };
say "engine_module: $engine_module";
my $eobj = $engine_module->new();	# engine object
$ir->setup( $eobj );
say "Setup completed.";

### 3. Assemble Configuration of Runtime ###

# by general engine configuration, game-specific config, and user-provided
# elements: environment, binary, arguments, potentially symlinks
# get unveil paths
# get engine-specific pledge promises
# get typical log file location

### 4. Fork + Exec Runtime (unless dryrun) ###

# with unveil + pledge as appropriate

### 5. Cleanup ###

# hint to typical log file location
